# Smart Hydroponic System

Hydroponics is soil-less agriculture farming, which consumes less water and other resources as compared to traditional soil-based agriculture systems. However, monitoring hydroponics farming is challenging due to the simultaneous supervising of numerous parameters, nutrition suggestions, and plant diagnosis systems

## OBJECTIVES
- To be able to provide a better temperature for plants to grow.
- To Control nutrient parameters in water.
- To Design such an application, Give the user all information regarding temperature, nutrient composition, and recent crop conditions.

## Components to Be Used:
1. Microcontroller (ESP32)
2. Air Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT 11)
3. Water Quality Sensor (TDS Sensor)
4. Water Temperature Sensor
5. Water PH Sensor

## System Architecture

## ADVANTAGES:
- Real-time data analysis and monitoring.
- Based on environmental parameters it will give readings accordingly.(for ex. Monitoring of temperature and humidity).
- Reduces Manual efforts Automation of nutrient delivery, continuous monitoring and adjustment of environmental parameters, efficient resource utilization.
- remote access and control for ease of management, and the potential for increased crop yields and quality through data-driven optimization.
- User can monitor and manage Hydroponic System anytime and anywhere.
